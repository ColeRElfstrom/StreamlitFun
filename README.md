# StreamlitFun

Tutorial for CPSC325 - Learning how to build a data science application/dashboard with Streamlit that can then be deployed FOR FREE to Streamlit. 

## For Setting Up Before Class

1. **Fork** (not CLONE) this GitHub repository. It's important that this GitHub repo is your own because we will link our GitHub accounts to Streamlit in order to be able to host our web app, so the repo must be under your name!
2. Install the `streamlit` package. You can do so through pip: `pip install streamlit`
   * Can also make a virtual environment of some sort if you don't want this messing with your current setup
3. Make sure that you have access to Google Cloud Console. We've already been doing this in class with Gina's tutorials, so this should already be set up. If you don't want this to mess with your other projects in Google Cloud, then also set up a new project. The rest of the cloud setup in Google Cloud we will be doing in class :)
4. Sign up for a [Streamlit account](https://streamlit.io/). We can't host for free through Streamlit without this!
